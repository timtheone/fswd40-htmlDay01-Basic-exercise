           I never meant to cause you any sorrow<br>
           I never meant to cause you any pain<br>
           I only wanted to one time to see you laughing<br>
           I only wanted to see you<br>
           Laughing in the purple rain

          I never wanted to be your weekend lover<br>
          I only wanted to be some kind of friend<br>
          Baby, I could never steal you from another<br>
          It's such a shame our friendship had to end

          Honey, I know, I know<br>
          I know times are changing<br>
          It's time we all reach out<br>
          For something new, that means you too<br>
          <br>
          You say you want a leader<br>
          But you can't seem to make up your mind<br>
          I think you better close it<br>
          And let me guide you to the purple rain

          Purple rain, purple rain<br>
          If you know what I'm singing about up here<br>
          C'mon, raise your hand<br>
          <br>
          Purple rain, purple rain<br>
          I only want to see you<br>
          Only want to see you<br>
          In the purple rain
